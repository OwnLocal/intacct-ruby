[ ![Codeship Status for jzornow/intacct-ruby](https://app.codeship.com/projects/161bbcb0-037f-0135-febb-660dbc75d940/status?branch=master)](https://app.codeship.com/projects/213338)

# IntacctRuby

A wrapper for [Intacct's API](https://developer.intacct.com/wiki/functions-object), which tries to stay as close as it can to the syntax and philosophy of the API itself.

## About this Fork

This is a third-generation fork of the [original IntacctRuby code](https://github.com/jzornow/intacct-ruby). The current tree looks like this:

```
jzornow/intacct-ruby
  |
  EnglishLanguageInstitute/intacct-ruby
    |
    TeamDriveAway/intacct-ruby
      |
      OwnLocal/intacct-ruby
```

The reason for the multiple forks is because the original code by jzornow is missing several features that have since been added by other contributors. However, OwnLocal still has requirements for our own Intacct sync that these other contributors have not added. Thus, this fork will ensure that (1) we can customize this gem for any of OwnLocal's unique requirements, and (2) the code remains stable, and we aren't blindsided by major changes or the code being removed from GitHub completely.

## The Power of Multi-Function Api Calls
Unlike the other Gems out in the Rubyverse, this library supports one of the Intacct API's most powerful features: multi-function API calls.

### Why Does This Matter?
In an ERP system like Intacct, you'll probably want to perform multiple actions at once, like debiting one account and crediting another, or creating several associated records simulatenously. The more calls you make, the longer it will take to see a response. That's just a fact. But if you can bundle all of those actions together into a single call, you lower the load on both your system and Intacct's servers and guarantee yourself a quicker response. Intacct's entire API is built around this idea, and `IntacctRuby` translates that philosophy into Ruby.

### How Do It Do?
Let's say you want to create a project and a customer associated with that project simultaneously. The Intacct API would tell you to create a call with a `<create><CUSTOMER>` function followed by a `<create><PROJECT>` function. So let's do it!

```ruby
# REQUEST_OPTS contains authentication information. See 'Authentication' section
# for more information.
request = IntacctRuby::Request.new(REQUEST_OPTS)

request.create :customer, {
  customerid: '1',
  first_name: 'Han',
  last_name: 'Solo',
  type: 'Person',
  email1: 'han@solo.com',
  status: 'active'
}

request.create :project, {
  projectid: '1',
  name: 'Get Chewie a Haircut',
  projectcategory: 'Improve Wookie Hygene',
  customerid: '1',
  shampoo: 'true', # a custom field
  blowdry: 'false' # a custom field
}

request.send
```

This will fire off a request that looks something like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<request>
   <control><!-- Authentication Params --></control>
   <operation transaction="true">
      <authentication><!-- Authentication Params --></authentication>
      <content>
         <function controlid="create-customer-2017-08-03 17:02:40 UTC">
            <create>
               <CUSTOMER>
                  <CUSTOMERID>1</CUSTOMERID>
                  <FIRST_NAME>Han</FIRST_NAME>
                  <LAST_NAME>Solo</LAST_NAME>
                  <TYPE>Person</TYPE>
                  <EMAIL1>han@solo.com</EMAIL1>
                  <STATUS>active</STATUS>
               </CUSTOMER>
            </create>
         </function>
         <function controlid="create-project-2017-08-03 17:02:40 UTC">
            <create>
               <PROJECT>
                  <PROJECTID>1</PROJECTID>
                  <NAME>Get Chewie a Haircut</NAME>
                  <PROJECTCATEGORY>Improve Wookie Hygene</PROJECTCATEGORY>
                  <CUSTOMERID>1</CUSTOMERID>
                  <SHAMPOO>true</SHAMPOO>
                  <BLOWDRY>false</BLOWDRY>
               </PROJECT>
            </create>
         </function>
      </content>
   </operation>
</request>
```
If there are function errors (e.g. you omitted a required field) you'll see an error on response. Same if you see an internal server error, or any error outside of the 2xx range.

## Authentication
Before we go any further, make sure you've read the [Intacct API Quickstart Guide](https://developer.intacct.com/web-services/) and [their article on constructing XML Requests](https://developer.intacct.com/web-services/requests/)

In IntacctRuby - as with the Intacct API that the gem wraps - your system credentials are pass along with each separate `Request` instance. The functions that define a request are followed by a hash that spells out each piece of information required by Intacct for authentication. These fields are:

- `senderid`
- `sender_password`\*
- `userid`
- `companyid`
- `user_password`\*

\* _In [Intacct's documentation](https://developer.intacct.com/wiki/constructing-web-services-request), these are referred to only as `password`. This won't work in Rubyland, though, because we can't have multiple hash entries with the same key._

### Authentication Example:

```ruby
IntacctRuby::Request.new(
  some_function,
  another_function,
  senderid: 'some_senderid_value',
  sender_password: 'some_sender_password_value',
  userid: 'some_userid_value',
  companyid: 'some_companyid_value',
  user_password: 'some_user_password_value'
)
```
Though, it probably makes more sense to keep all of these in some handy constant for easy reuse:
```ruby
REQUEST_OPTS = {
  senderid: 'some_senderid_value',
  sender_password: 'some_sender_password_value',
  userid: 'some_userid_value',
  companyid: 'some_companyid_value',
  user_password: 'some_user_password_value'
}.freeze

IntacctRuby::Request.new(REQUEST_OPTS)
```

### Important Notes on Authentication
#### These Are Required!
Obviously, Intacct won't do anything if you don't tell it who you are. To save you the bandwidth, **this gem will throw errors if any of these auth params are not provided.**

#### BE SAFE!
Though the examples above show hard-coded username/password pairs, this is a really bad idea to do in production code. Instead, we recommend storing these variables in ENVs, using a tool like [Figaro](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro) to bring it all together.

## Customizing Calls

This gem creates calls using the following defaults:
- **uniqueid:** false,
- **dtdversion:** 3.0,
- **includewhitespace:** false,
- **transaction:** true

If you'd like to override any of these, you can do so when you create a new request by adding additional fields to the options hash passed into `Request#new`:

```ruby
REQUEST_OPTS = {
  senderid: 'some_senderid_value',
  sender_password: 'some_sender_password_value',
  userid: 'some_userid_value',
  companyid: 'some_companyid_value',
  user_password: 'some_user_password_value'
}

REQUEST_OPTS.merge!(
  uniqueid: 'some_uniqueid_override',
  dtdversion: 'some_dtd_override'
)

IntacctRuby::Request.new(REQUEST_OPTS)
```
